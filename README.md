# Paw-Path
The index.html file is the code from Mapbox Directions API help page that we used as a basis for the PawPath application.
Users can enter a starting address and select a breed from a drop-down that is linked to the database. 
Once the user clicks the Find Route, button, the starting point is passed to the html component and the map is rendered zooming to the coordinates for the starting address.
The user clicks on the map to select the destination point.
Breed specific information is also displayed.
