# Paw-Path
The index.html file is the code from Mapbox Directions API help page that we used as a basis for the PawPath application.
We changed the default map view to show Penn State, University Park.
Users can enter a starting address and select a breed from a drop-down that is linked to the database.  They also select the animal's age.
On the map, the blue dot is the hard-coded starting point. The user clicks on the map to select the destination point.
The Find Route button is not yet fully functional. That will be part of our enhanced implementation.
