Users go to the navigation page from the Home page by clicking on the Get Started button or clickong on the PawPath tab at the top of the page.
To calculate a walking route, user selects a breed from the drop-down menu and enters a starting address into the address field.  
  The breed drop-down field is linked to the database to be used for quering information
  When the user starts entering an address, the system will show a drop-down of potential address matches. 
To run the application, the user clicks the Find Route button
  The starting point is passed to the html component and the map is rendered zooming to the coordinates for the starting address.
The user clicks on the map to select the destination point.
The route is highlighted and turn-by-turn instructions are also included.
Breed specific information is also displayed.
If the user wants to change the destination, they can easily do so by clickin another location directly on the map.
Pressing and holding Ctrl + left-click allows you to drag the map and change the vantage point so you can see the type of terrain on the route.
